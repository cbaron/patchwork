        <h2>Internships</h2>
        <p>Patchwork Gardens is happy to offer internship opportunities for those interested in immersing themselves in the work and lifestyle of chemical-free farming.  We prefer candidates who are able to work full time (40-60 hours/week) and willing to stay with us for the length of the growing season (mid-April - November).  We work also in the Winter months and we welcome applicants to contact us at any time during the year.  The right person could have the opportunity to become a long-term partner in the farm.  We are a young and fun group, learning fast and making progress in our first seven years of growing.  We are fast-expanding in the Dayton area and we seek applicants whose energy will help us grow our business.</p>
