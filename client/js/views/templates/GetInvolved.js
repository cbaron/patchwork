        <h2>Internships</h2>
        <p>Patchwork Gardens is happy to offer internship opportunities for those interested in immersing themselves in the work and lifestyle of chemical-free farming. We prefer candidates who are able to work full-time (40-60 hours/week) and willing to stay with us for the length of the entire growing season (mid-April &ndash; November). There's also work to be done in winter, so we gladly welcome applicants any time of year. The right person could have the opportunity to become a long-term partner in the farm. We are a young, energetic group, learning fast and making progress in our first seven years of growing. We are quickly expanding in the Dayton area and seek applicants whose energy will help us grow our business.</p>
